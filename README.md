# Experience:
The following contains some brief information about my current experience in DevOps.

## Cloud & Dev Ops
### Explanation of cloud:
Cloud as a role involves the connection of applications to the internet put simply. This role involves taking applications that have been created and creating the necessary infastructure to connect them to dependant applications, such as a Database, as well as making the application accessible on the internet. This role involves the utilization of many different tools in order to create a product that can be easily updated, maintained and pushed to production. Cloud also utilizes a more forward thinking resource model, with data centers being used rather than on site server racks.

### AWS:
- Deployed multiple AWS instances.
- Created a VPC using terraform.
- Developed a pipeline that can automatically update an application based on a push to the main branch on github.


### Benefits of using Cloud
There are many benefits to Cloud but perhaps the most notable one would have to be the benefit of using Data centers over on site servers. The pay as you go model that many different cloud providers offer allows companies to better allocate resources to their applications and respond to demand much faster than they previously could using On Site resources. With this flexibility in the way companies can attack publication of their products, it has never been easier for companies of all sizes to maintain and publish their products.
